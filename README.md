# SocketProject
• Designed a server using threads that allows concurrent users to navigate through the server’s directory.
• Leveraged socket and Pickle library to serialize/deserialize user inputs.
• Reduced memory consumption by automatically closing any unused threads for a set period. 


# Direction:
1. Start the server program through command line with conditions.  
2. Start the client program (as much as user wants).
3. Navigate through the server's directory by following the direction sent by the server.
