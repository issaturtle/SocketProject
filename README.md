# SocketProject
- Created a server to accept x amount of clients with a set amount of time.
- Leveraged Pickle library to decode/encode user input through sockets.
- Implemented threading pools to handle concurrent users in the server.

# Direction:
1. Start the server program through command line with conditions.  
2. Start the client program (as much as user wants).
3. Navigate through the server's directory by following the direction sent by the server.
