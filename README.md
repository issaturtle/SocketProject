# SocketProject
- Created a server that allows users to navigate through the directories.
- Leveraged Pickle library to decode/encode user input through sockets.
- Implemented threading pools to handle concurrent users on the server.
- Automatically close unused threads to prevent wasting memory.

# Direction:
1. Start the server program through command line with conditions.  
2. Start the client program (as much as user wants).
3. Navigate through the server's directory by following the direction sent by the server.
